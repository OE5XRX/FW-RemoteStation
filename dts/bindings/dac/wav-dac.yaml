  WAV File DAC Emulator
  
  This driver emulates a DAC by writing audio samples to a WAV file.
  Useful for testing and simulation on platforms without real hardware DAC.
  
  The sample rate and bits-per-sample are configured via Kconfig:
  - CONFIG_DAC_WAV_SAMPLE_RATE (default: 8000 Hz)
  - CONFIG_DAC_WAV_BITS_PER_SAMPLE (default: 16-bit)
  
  Example devicetree node:
  
    wav_dac: dac@0 {
        compatible = "wav-dac";
        #io-channel-cells = <1>;
        output-file = "audio_output.wav";
        channels = <1>;
    };

compatible: "wav-dac"

include: [dac-controller.yaml]

  - channel
